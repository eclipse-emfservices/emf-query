# EMF Query - part of Eclipse [EMF Services](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.emfservices)

**NOTE**: EMF Query, along with the rest of EMF Services, has moved to GitHub. The new official location of the source code is at https://github.com/eclipse/emf-query.

The EMF Query component which lives [here](https://github.com/eclipse/emf-query) is officially no longer supported or maintained as of May 2020. Starting from version 1.13, EMF Services will no longer ship this component.

In practice, the last non-trivial source code change dates back to December 2009, so this is really just making official the long-existing situation.

If someone is interested in reviving this component and maintaining it, please contact the project lead or committers of the EMF Services project, of which EMF Query is/was a sub-component: https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.emfservices/who.
