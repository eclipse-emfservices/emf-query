The EMF Query component which lives here is officially no longer
supported or maintained as of May 2020. Starting from version 1.13,
EMF Services will no longer ship this component.

In practice, the last non-trivial source code change dates back to
December 2009, so this is really just making official the
long-existing situation.

If someone is interested in reviving this component and maintaining
it, please contact the project lead or committers of the EMF Services
project, of which EMF Query is/was a sub-component:
https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.emfservices/who.
